# paste.solutions
I believe that it should be simple to share code snippets, and that's what I hope to accomplish with this service.

## Usage

New pastes can be created at https://paste.solutions/.
They can be saved by either pressing the 'save' icon, or by pressing Ctrl + S.

## Viewing snippets

The format of the endpoint is https://paste.solutions/{id}.{extension}.
The Extension can be omitted or replaced when highlight js doesn't determine the right language.

If you need to view the raw content of the paste, simply append **/raw** to the url. 

You can also click on the line numbers to get an anchor to that line.

## Lifetime of snippets

Currently there is no lifetime limit, but in future I'll be pruning all snippets older than 10 days.
